## Usage
```
usage: pge_lake_tile.py [-h] command_file

Compute SWOT LakeTile product from one tile of PIXC product and its associated PIXCVecRiver product.

positional arguments:
  command_file  command file (*.cfg)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
```

### Command file
The command file must contain the following (example provided in ```PGE/pge_lake_tile_command.cfg```):
```
[PATHS]
param_file = <full_path_to_param_file>
PIXC file = <full_path_to_PIXC_file>
PIXCVecRiver file = <full_path_to_PIXCVecRiver_file>
Output directory = <output_directory>

[DATABASES]
# Lake a priori database
LAKE_DB = <full_path_to_lake_DB_file>
# Lake identifier attribute name in the database
LAKE_DB_ID = <string>
# Shapefile with polygons of continents
CONTINENT_FILE = <full_path_to_continent_shapefile>

[OPTIONS]
# To also produce LakeTile_edge and LakeTile_pixcvec as shapefiles (=True); else=False (default)
Produce shp = <True|False>

[LOGGING]
# Log filename
logFile = <full_path_to_log_file>
# Log level put inside the file
logfilelevel = <DEBUG|INFO>
# Is log console output ?
logConsole = <True|False>
# Log level print in console
logconsolelevel = <DEBUG|INFO>
```

### Parameter file
If the __param_file__ key is not set in the command file, the software uses default configuration parameters listed in ```PGE/lake_tile_param.cfg```. If the __param_file__ key is set , the software will use your own configuration parameters.

They are:
* __FLAG_WATER__ is the list of water flags to keep for processing (3=water near land edge  4=interior water)
* __FLAG_DARK__ is the list of dark water flags to keep for processing (23=dark water near land edge  24=interior dark water)
* __FLAG_LAYOVER__ is the list of layover flags to keep for processing
* __MIN_SIZE__ is the minimum size for a lake to generate a lake product (=polygon + attributes) for it
* __STD_HEIGHT_MAX__ is the maximal standard deviation of height inside a lake; this value is used to distinguish different lakes that may be merged in the radar geometry
* __IMP_GEOLOC__ is the flag to improve PixC golocation (=True) or not (=False)
* __HULL_METHOD__ is the method to compute lake boundary (or polygon hull): 0=convex hull 1=concav hull (1.0=with alpha param (default) 1.1=without) 2=concav hull radar vectorisation
* __BIGLAKE_MODEL, BIGLAKE_MIN_SIZE, BIGLAKE_GRID_SPACING, BIGLAKE_GRID_RES__ are parameters specific to the processing of "big" lakes, ie. lakes with an area greater than BIGLAKE_MIN_SIZE
* __NB_DIGITS__ are the number of digits for a counter of lakes in a tile or pass, used in the LakeID of each observed lake
* __PATTERN[...]__ are patterns for filenames used in LOCNES

### Input files

#### The pixel cloud PIXC file
The filename pattern should be ```SWOT_L2_HR_PIXC_I_<ccc>_<ppp>_<ttt><s>_<yyyyMMddThhmmss>_<yyyyMMddThhmmss>_<CRID>_<nn>``` where:
* __ccc__ is the cycle number, on 3 digits
* __ppp__ is the pass number, on 3 digits
* __ttt__ is the tile reference, on 3 digits
* __s__ is the swath: =L for Left swath =R for right swath
* First __yyyyMMddThhmmss__ is the start date of the tile
* Second __yyyyMMddThhmmss__ is the end date of the tile
* __CRID__ is the Composite Release IDentifier
* __nn__ is a product counter with the same CRID

NB: this pattern can be modified in the configuration file (see hereafter).

#### The PIXCVecRiver file
This is the file complementary to the PIXC file, containing improved geolocation and link to a priori data for each pixel already processed by the RiverTile processor (see flow diagram).

The filename pattern should be ```SWOT_L2_HR_PIXCVecRiver_<ccc>_<ppp>_<ttt><s>_<yyyyMMddThhmmss>_<yyyyMMddThhmmss>_<CRID>_<nn>``` where:
* __ccc__ is the cycle number, on 3 digits
* __ppp__ is the pass number, on 3 digits
* __ttt__ is the tile reference, on 3 digits
* __s__ is the swath: =L for Left swath =R for right swath
* First __yyyyMMddThhmmss__ is the start date of the tile
* Second __yyyyMMddThhmmss__ is the end date of the tile
* __CRID__ is the Composite Release IDentifier
* __nn__ is a product counter with the same CRID

NB: this pattern can be modified in the configuration file (see hereafter).

NB2: a test is done to verify compatibility of input files regarding their filenames (orbit infos). If something strange is noticed, a WARNING is risen, but it's not blocking.

### Lake a priori database
If the __LAKE_DB__ parameter is set in the command file, each lake polygon in the output product will be linked (if possible) to one or more lakes of this a priori database.

The __LAKE_DB__ is the full path of the lake a priori database. It must be a polygon shapefile, each object being a prior lake. The identifier of each object is defined in the command file, by the __LAKE_DB_ID__ parameter. Therefore, the *prior_id* attribute in the output shapefile will point toward one or more *lake_id* of the lake a priori database.

Furthermore, if there are 2 more attributes names *ref_height* and *ref_area* in the a priori database, the storage change will be computed with regards to these reference values.

NB: if the __LAKE_DB__ parameter is not set, output lake polygons are not linked to prior lakes and, therefore, the storage change is not computed.

### Continent file

As the LakeSP products are split per pass and continent, LakeTile products refer to a continent. This continent split is set by the __CONTINENT_FILE__ key in the command file.

This file must be a polygon shapefile, with at least an attribute named *MAJ_BAS* equal to:
* 1 for North America
* 2 for Central Ameria + Caribbean island
* 3 for South America
* 4 for Europe
* 5 for East Asia
* 6 for West Asia
* 7 for Africa
* 8 for Oceania (including Australia)
* 9 for Antarctica

NB: if the __CONTINENT_FILE__ parameter is not set, the LakeTile product is not linked to a continent.

### Output files
The LakeTile pattern is ```SWOT_L2_HR_LakeTile_<ccc>_<ppp>_<ttt><s>_<yyyyMMddThhmmss>_<yyyyMMddThhmmss>_<CRID>_<nn>``` where:
* __ccc__ is the cycle number, on 3 digits
* __ppp__ is the pass number, on 3 digits
* __ttt__ is the tile reference, on 3 digits
* __s__ is the swath: =L for Left swath =R for right swath
* First __yyyyMMddThhmmss__ is the start date of the tile
* Second __yyyyMMddThhmmss__ is the end date of the tile
* __CRID__ is the Composite Release IDentifier
* __nn__ is a product counter with the same CRID

The LakeTile product is composed of 3 files:
* "[pattern].shp" contains the lake product for each lake entirely covered by the swath
* "[pattern]_pixcvec.nc" contains the PIXCVec product (ie. improved geolocation and link to a priori data for each pixel already processed by the RiverTile processor and pixels of lake entirely covered by the swath)
* "[pattern]_edge.nc" contains the subset of PIXC file for pixels belonging to lakes cut at the top or bottom of the tile edge


## Multi-tile processing
```
usage: multi_lake_tile.py [-h] command_file

Compute SWOT LakeTile products from multiple tiles of PIXC products and their associated PIXCVecRiver products.

positional arguments:
  command_file  command file (*.cfg)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
```

The command file must contain same as the one for ```pge_lake_tile.py``` and a section dedicated to tiles caracteristics (example provided in ```PGE/multi_lake_tile_command.cfg```):
```
[TILES_INFOS]
# Format = int; if empty, deal with all PixC files in PIXC directory
Cycle number = <int>
# Format = int; if empty, deal with all PixC files of the cycle defined above in PIXC directory
#Pass number = <int>
# Tile reference (ttt) and swath (s) in string format ("ttts"); if empty, deal with all PixC files of cycle "Cycle" and pass "Pass" in PIXC directory
#Tile ref = <ttts>
```

NB: if not used, parameters HAVE TO be removed or in comment (#)

In particular:
* __Cycle number__ is the number of the cycle to process; if empty, all the PixC files in PIXC directory will be processed
* __Pass number__ is the number of the pass to process, associated to the cycle number above; if empty, deal with all PixC files of __Cycle number__ in PIXC directory
* __Tile ref__ is the tile reference (ttt) and swath (s) in string format ("ttts"); if empty, deal with all PixC files of cycle and pass numbers above in PIXC directory

## Algorithm main steps

1. Preprocessing:
	1. Test the existence of input paths
	2. Retrieve tile infos from PIXC filename
	3. Retrieve lake a priori database information
	4. Retrieve data from PIXC and PIXCVecRiver input files, i.e. pixels not already processed by RiverTile processor
2. Processing
	1. Identify all separate entities in the water mask (radar geometry)
	2. Get pixels corresponding to objects entirely inside the tile
	3. Fill LakeTile shapefile for each object entirely inside the tile: refine geolocation, compute attributes, eventually link to 1 or more lakes from a priori database 
3. Post-processing
	1. Close LakeTile shapefile
	2. Write LakeTile_pixcvec.nc file = PIXCVecRiver file + same info for pixels of objects entirely inside the tile (may be empty)
	3. Write LakeTile_edge.nc file = subset of PIXC for each pixel of object at top or bottom edge of the tile (may be empty)
	4. Close lake a priori database
