!== Height ==

!### Option 1 - Constant height model, uniform over each water body; height varies sinusoidally with time
!Specific option: [Height model A = 0.] & [!Height model] => no height applied, height in output onlyt contains errors
!### Constant height model parameters (same height for each water body) 
Constant height model A = 0.  !=0 to disable
Constant height model t0 = 47076
Constant height model period (days) = 365.25
!### Complex 2D height model parameters (2D variations added for lakes > [Height model min area]) 
!Height model = polynomial    !=polynomial or gaussian; if disabled, only constant height model
!Height 2d model min area = 100.     !(ha) min area of water bodies on which to add complex 2D height model (default=100.)
!Height 2d model stdv = 1.        !stdv for gaussian model (ie Height model = gaussian)

!### Option 2 - Height is given from a specific attribute in the shapefile of water bodies
!Height model = reference_height
