## Background 

SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) is an innovative radar altimetry satellite mission projected for launch in 2021, prepared jointly by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the UK Space Agency (UKSA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). SWOT features a high-rate (HR) data mode for continental hydrology, and a low-rate (LR) data mode dedicated mainly to oceanography. For more information, refer to https://swot.cnes.fr/en/ or https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/. 

## Objectives 
* Provide open-source tools that, together with JPL’s RiverObs tool (https://github.com/SWOTAlgorithms/RiverObs.git), enable end-users to generate virtually all SWOT HR level-2 (L2) products with fairly (but not fully) representative characteristics (see section on caveats below)
  * Get familiar with product content and formats, use the data to conduct studies...
* Give end-users access to the L2+ processing prototypes 
  * Validate methodology, propose improvements...
* As far as possible let the toolbox correspond directly to the processing prototypes that are evolving towards operational processing chains 
  * Coded in high-level programming language (Python 3), for simple distribution, installation and use

```
Note that both algorithms and products are still under development and will be updated regularly.
```

## Content 
* SISIMP: Large scale simulator of L2_HR_PIXC products (with orbit selection tool)
* LOCNES: Generation of L2_HR_LAKE* and L2_HR_PIXC_VEC products 
* Improved geolocation library (used by RiverObs and LOCNES)
* Module to generate L2_HR_RASTER products (under development, not yet included)
* Overall script permitting to run all steps consecutively (with example dataset)
* Tools for file format conversion etc.
* Potentially other modules in the future (for ex. floodplain DEM generation)

## Associated RiverObs version
Currently in prd-v5 branch, should be pushed into develop soon

## Caveats
Although the large-scale simulator included in the toolbox provides fairly representative statistical errors, several simplifications or approximations are made:
* Spherical Earth approximate geolocation equations (loss of accuracy at high latitudes, >60°)
* No topography is taken into account 
  * Radar geometry grid constructed on sphere
  * No geometric distortions, no layover 
* Simplified representation of water height (several options) 
  * Spatially constant height for each water body (but possibility to vary height over time, cycle)
  * Spatially random correlated heights, and 2D polynomial model (with synthetic slopes)
  * Also possible to inject “true” heights from models (after simulation)
  * Random effective instrument noise added to height (and propagated to geolocation)
* Idealized pixel cloud processing 
* Dark water synthetic model (correlated random fields used to simulate low reflectivity areas)
* Geoid (mean tide corrected EGM-2008), tropospheric and corr-over residual errors simulated

## When do you use the simulator:
* Large areas studies and multitemporal studies 
* When a precise representation of phenomenology (layover, algorithm errors, etc.) is not relevent 
* When you don't want to use a precise slope model as input (option is currently in development)
* To study the inpact of water bodies complex geometry on River and Lake processing 

```
If a higher degree of realism is necessary to conduct a study, lower-level simulators and processors need to be employed. 
These are not publicly available, but SWOT science team members can contact the SWOT algorithm development team for support.

Products formats and algorithms:
* The product formats are not now in their official version, but can still evolve if the official product formats is changed. Some data fields are at this stage void (various flags, uncertainty indicators…).
* The processing algorithms will also continue to evolve, as today's prototypes are progessively refined into operational software. 

Last modifications:
In large scale simulator:
* Uncertainties on geolocated heights added
* Multilook adaptive averaging implemented
* Land pixels around water bodies added (label 1 and 2 on classification field)
* Near-range computaton improved
* Some fields corrected-completed

In processing chain
* Lake processing improvements
* Lake Single pass processing added (cf leman and france_pekel new dataset to test it, can't be pushed on github, but can't be share through CNES cluster if needed)
```bash
% python ../../scripts/laketile_to_lakesp.py output/lakesp rdf/multi_lake_sp_command.cfg output/lake/lake-annotation_*
```


## Installation procedure

### Get the repository
1. Clone __swot_hydrology_toolbox__ repo

```bash
% git clone https://github.com/cnes/swot-hydrology-toolbox.git
