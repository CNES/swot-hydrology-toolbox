## Background 

SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) is an innovative radar altimetry satellite mission projected for launch in 2021, prepared jointly by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the UK Space Agency (UKSA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). SWOT features a high-rate (HR) data mode for continental hydrology, and a low-rate (LR) data mode dedicated mainly to oceanography. For more information, refer to https://swot.cnes.fr/en/ or https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/. 

## Objectives 
* Provide open-source tools that, together with JPL’s RiverObs tool (https://github.com/SWOTAlgorithms/RiverObs.git), enable end-users to generate virtually all SWOT HR level-2 (L2) products with fairly realistic errors
  * Get familiar with product content and formats, use the data to conduct studies...
* Give end-users access to the L2+ processing prototypes 
  * Validate methodology, propose improvements
* As far as possible let the toolbox correspond directly to the processing prototypes that are evolving towards operational processing chains 
  *Coded in high-level programming language (Python 3), for simple distribution, installation and use

## Content 
* SISIMP: Large scale simulator of L2_HR_PIXC products (with orbit selection tool)
* LOCNES: Generation of L2_HR_LAKE* and L2_HR_PIXC_VEC products 
* Improved geolocation library (used by RiverObs and LOCNES)
* Module to generate L2_HR_RASTER products (under development, not yet included)
* Overall script permitting to run all steps consecutively 
* Tools for file format conversion etc.
* Potentially other modules in the future (for ex. floodplain DEM generation)

## Caveats
Although the large-scale simulator included in the toolbox provides fairly representative statistical errors, several simplifications or approximations are made:
* Spherical Earth approximate geolocation equations (loss of accuracy at high latitudes, >60°)
* No topography is taken into account 
  * Radar geometry grid constructed on sphere
  * No geometric distortions, no layover 
* Simplified representation of water height (several options) 
  * Spatially constant height for each water body (but possibility to vary height over time, cycle)
  * Spatially random correlated heights, and 2D polynomial model (with synthetic slopes)
  * Also possible to inject “true” heights from models (after simulation)
  * Random effective instrument noise added to height (and propagated to geolocation)
* Perfect water detection (the ideal water mask is projected into radar geometry)
* Some data fields are at this stage void (various flags, uncertainty indicators…)

## Installation procedure

### Get the repository
1. Clone __swot_hydrology_toolbox__ repo

```bash
% git clone https://github.com/cnes/swot-hydrology-toolbox.git
```
The repository __swot_hydrology_toolbox__ should be assignated to the __SWOT_HYDROLOGY_TOOLBOX__ variable.

```bash
% export SWOT_HYDROLOGY_TOOLBOX=your_installation_path/swot-hydrology-toolbox
```

2. Clone __RiverObs__ repo

```bash
% git clone https://github.com/SWOTAlgorithms/RiverObs.git
```

The repository __RiverObs__ be assignated to the __RIVEROBS__ variable.

```bash
% export RIVEROBS=your_installation_path/RiverObs
```
