!### Orbit parameters
!3 options =
!Multiple orbit = yes (default) => all orbit files in Orbit directory will be processed
!Multiple orbit = no => set the Orbit to a correct number found in the Orbit directory; only this orbit file will be processed
!Multiple orbit = passplan => orbit files will be processed according to passplan.txt file (generated if passplan = yes in select_orbit.rdf)
Multiple orbit = no !=no/yes/passplan

NR cross track = 10000.
Sensor wavelength = 0.0084

!### Error parameters
Height bias std = 0.1
Noise multiplier factor = 0.5 !1/sqrt(Nl) where Nl is 4
Geolocalisation improvement = no !yes (no cross-track noise applied) or no

!### Dark water parameters
Dark water = no !yes (dark water simulation is executed) or no
!Scale factor dw = 2.0  !correlation length of simulated dark water areas (float)
!Dark water percentage = 10  !probability of total dark water simulated (int between 0 and 100)
!Dark water flag = 24  !classification flag for detected dark water (usually 24)
!Dark water seed = 1234567891  !int seed to be used for reproducible dark water simulations

!### Files in output
Create shapefile = yes !Produce output files also as shapefiles
Create dummy pixc vec river file = yes !Produce L2_HR_PIXCVecRiver product associated to PixC files


!== Height ==

!### Option 1 - Constant height model, uniform over each water body; height varies sinusoidally with time
!Specific option: [Height model A = 0.] & [!Height model] => no height applied, height in output onlyt contains errors
!### Constant height model parameters (same height for each water body) 
Constant height model A = 0.  !=0 to disable
Constant height model t0 = 47076
Constant height model period (days) = 365.25
!### Complex 2D height model parameters (2D variations added for lakes > [Height model min area]) 
!Height model = gaussian    !=polynomial or gaussian; if disabled, only constant height model
!Height 2d model min area = 100.     !(ha) min area of water bodies on which to add complex 2D height model (default=100.)
!Height 2d model stdv = 0.2        !stdv for gaussian model (ie Height model = gaussian)

!### Option 2 - Height is given from a specific attribute in the shapefile of water bodies
!Height model = reference_height
!Height shp attribute name = ref_height     !Name of the attribute (default=HEIGHT)

!### Option 3 - Height is given in a NetCDF file
!Height model = reference_file
!True height file = $SWOT_HYDROLOGY_TOOLBOX/test/river_and_lake/data/true_height_model_river_and_lake.nc
