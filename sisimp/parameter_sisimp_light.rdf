!### Orbit parameters: 
!3 options =
!Multiple orbit = yes (default) => all orbit files in Orbit directory will be processed
!Multiple orbit = no => set the Orbit to a correct number found in the Orbit directory; only this orbit file will be processed
!Multiple orbit = passplan => orbit files will be processed according to passplan.txt file (generated if passplan = yes in select_orbit.rdf)
Multiple orbit = no !=no/yes/passplan
Orbit = 266

!### Files in output
Create shapefile = yes !Produce output files also as shapefiles
Create dummy pixc vec river file = yes !Produce L2_HR_PIXCVecRiver product associated to PixC files
